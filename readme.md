What is this?!
=============================

This is my dumb project where I played around with R during the afternoon
after the UFC on Fox show where Werdum x Browne took place. It was a really
great event and everyone at my house loved it, however when we the ratings
came out, they were *really* not great.

So, I put together this script (and the report it generates) to try to understand
how bad the actual state of affairs is. Turns out, not great.
