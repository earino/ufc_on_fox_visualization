What is this?!
=============================

This is my dumb project where I played around with R during the afternoon
after the UFC on Fox show where Werdum x Browne took place. It was a really
great event and everyone at my house loved it, however when we the ratings
came out, they were *really* not great.

So, I put together this script (and the report it generates) to try to understand
how bad the actual state of affairs is. Turns out, not great, but not the end
of the world.

I have added the data from Bellator viewership from the same time period since the
UFC has been on Fox. The trends are pretty interesting, honestly, but I think more
than anything it shows that the future is uncertain.
